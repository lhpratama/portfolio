## 1.1 Notes on Specific Variables

track_name: Name of the song
artist(s)_name: Name of the artist(s) of the song
artist_count: Number of artists contributing to the song
released_year: Year when the song was released
released_month: Month when the song was released
released_day: Day of the month when the song was released
in_spotify_playlists: Number of Spotify playlists the song is included in
in_spotify_charts: Presence and rank of the song on Spotify charts

## 1.2 Objectives

The objective of this Rmd are to find:

1. The most played song on Spotify
2. The most famous artist on Spotify
3. The most optimal way to release a song on Spotify to increase stream count

# 2. DATA PREPARATION 

The First step is inserting the csv file into R located in data_input and then installing the necessary plugins.

## 2.1 Importing Libraries

```{r}
library(dplyr) #install package dplyr to manipulate character data
library(scales) #install package scales
library(ggplot2) #install package ggplot2 for data visualization
library(leaflet) #install package leaflet for map plotting
library(tidyr) #install package tidyr for seperating rows
library(stringi) #install package stringi for handling multibyte characters
```

## 2.2 Importing Dataset

```{r}
#Read data csv
spotify <- read.csv("data_input/spotify-2023.csv")
```

Inspecting the imported dataset using head()

```{r}
head(spotify)
```

# 3. DATA CLEANING

## 3.1 Checking Datatypes
```{r}
str(spotify)
```
The songs listed in the data have a wide range of release dates, spanning from 1930 to 2023.

```{r}
summary(spotify$released_year)
```
From the table, it can be concluded that, on average, songs have only 1 artist, while only a few of the top Spotify songs are the result of collaborations with other artists.

```{r}
sort(table(spotify$artist_count), decreasing = T)
```

## 3.2 Subsetting


```{r}
spotify_sub <- select(spotify, 1:9)

spotify_sub
```



## 3.3 New columns

```{r}
# Creating a new column for Month name
spotify_sub$month <- as.factor(month.abb[spotify_sub$released_month])

# Checking Head Data
head(spotify_sub)
```

## 3.4 Converting column type

```{r}
spotify_sub <- spotify_sub %>%
  mutate_at(vars(released_year, released_month, released_day), as.factor) %>%
  mutate(streams = as.integer(streams))

head(spotify_sub)
```



## 3.5 Missing Data
```{r}
spotify_sub[spotify_sub == ""] <- NA
str(spotify_sub)
```


```{r}
colSums(is.na(x = spotify_sub))
```
```{r}
spotify_sub <- na.omit(spotify_sub)
```


## 3.6 Duplicates

```{r}
spotify_sub <- spotify_sub[!duplicated(spotify_sub$track_name, fromLast = TRUE), ]
```

## 3.7 Separating Rows

Separating rows of songs who has two or more artists.
```{r}
spotify_sep <- separate_rows(spotify_sub, artist.s._name, sep = ",")
head(spotify_sep)
```


#4. DATA PROCESSING
```{r}
spotify_sub
```


## 4.1 Most played Song in Spotify

```{r}
top_spotify <- spotify_sub %>%
  group_by(track_name) %>%
  arrange(-streams) %>%
  head(20,)

#Necessary columns
top_spotify[c("track_name", "streams")]
  
```

From the plot, it can be read that the most popular songs on Spotify in 2023 are "Take Me To Church," "Circles," and "Love Yourself."
```{r}
#Plotting Top Songs on Spotify
ggplot(data = top_spotify, aes(x = streams,
                              y = reorder(track_name, streams), fill = streams) # Add fill aesthetic
                ) +
  geom_col(width = 0.6, col = "white") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "black", high = "green") +
    labs(title="Top Songs on Spotify", 
       subtitle="by 2023",
       x = "Stream Count",
       y = NULL) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
## 4.2 Top Artist on Spotify
```{r}
artist_spotify <- spotify_sep %>%
  group_by(artist.s._name) %>%
  summarise(stream = sum(streams)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(-stream)%>%
  head(20,)


artist_spotify
```

From the plot, it can be determined that the top artist on Spotify in 2023 is Bad Bunny with a total stream count of 1,504,423,768. Following closely is Taylor Swift with a total stream count of 1,442,323,826, and The Weeknd with a total stream count of 1,346,847,495.


```{r}
#Plotting Top Artists on Spotify
ggplot(data = artist_spotify, aes(x = stream,
                              y = reorder(artist.s._name, stream), fill = stream) # Add fill aesthetic
                ) +
  geom_col(width = 0.6, col = "white") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "black", high = "green") +
    labs(title="Top Artists on Spotify", 
       subtitle="by 2023",
       x = "Stream Count",
       y = NULL) +
  theme_minimal() 
```

```{r}
spotify_sub
```

## 4.3 Most Optimal Way to Release Songs on Spotify
```{r}
#Creating a new column to count the number of song released per ROW
spotify_sub <- spotify_sub %>%
  mutate(nsong = "1") %>%
  mutate(nsong = as.integer(nsong))
```

```{r}
#Creating a new dataset
month_spotify <- spotify_sub %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(songs = sum(nsong)) %>%
  ungroup()

#Creating a new order for dataset
m_order <- c(
  "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun",
  "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"
)

month_spotify <- month_spotify[match(m_order, month_spotify$month),]

month_spotify
```

From the plot, it can be discerned that many songs released in January become popular, followed by May with a similar number of songs.

```{r}
#Plotting
ggplot(data = month_spotify, aes(x = month, y = songs, fill = songs)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkgreen") +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Songs Released In That Month", 
    subtitle="on Spotify",
    x = NULL,
    y = "Songs"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()+
  scale_x_discrete(limits = m_order)
```
```{r}
#Creating a new dataset
month_spotify_streams <- spotify_sub %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(stream = sum(streams)) %>%
  ungroup()



month_spotify_streams <- month_spotify_streams[match(m_order, month_spotify_streams$month),]

month_spotify_streams
```

From the plot, it can be observed that January has the highest number of song streams, followed by May and March. However, there is a significant difference in the number of streams between January and May.

```{r}
#Plotting
ggplot(data = month_spotify_streams, aes(x = month, y = stream, fill = stream)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkgreen") +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Streams of Songs Released on that Month", 
    subtitle="on Spotify",
    x = NULL,
    y = "Streams"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()+
  scale_x_discrete(limits = m_order)
```
```{r}
#Combining two datasets
month_spotify_comb <- full_join (month_spotify, month_spotify_streams, by = "month") %>%
  group_by (month) %>%
  mutate(avg_stream = stream / songs) #new column to count average streams per song released on the month

month_spotify_comb
```


From the plot, it can be concluded that the highest average streams are typically in January, followed by September and August. Despite many songs being released in May, the average stream count in that month is relatively low compared to other months.

```{r}
ggplot(data = month_spotify_comb, aes(x = month, y = avg_stream, fill = avg_stream)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkgreen") +
  labs(
    title = "Average Streams of Songs Released on that Month", 
    subtitle="on Spotify",
    x = NULL,
    y = "Streams"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()+
  scale_x_discrete(limits = m_order)
```
